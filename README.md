# Dimensionality-reduction
Dimensionality reduction is the process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration, by obtaining a set of principal variables. It can be divided into feature selection and feature extraction.
some of the benefits of applying dimensionality reduction to a dataset:
Less dimensions lead to less computation/training time
Some algorithms do not perform well when we have a large dimensions. So reducing these dimensions needs to happen for the algorithm to be useful.
It takes care of multicollinearity by removing redundant features
